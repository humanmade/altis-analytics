Analytics is the gathering, understanding and application of data to measure, improve and make sites smarter.

## Native Analytics

Altis provides its own analytics layer as part of the infrastructure by default. This provides numerous benefits, not only from the perspective of GDPR, privacy, and owning your data but it enables powerful features including real time stats, AB testing, and personalization.

## Web Experiments

Built on top of the native analytics feature the web experimentation framework provides editorial teams with features such as A/B testing to test the effectiveness of their content and developers with an extensible API for creating custom tests.

## Google Tag Manager

There are many 3rd party providers of analytics so this module provides a simple interface to add [Google Tag Manager](https://tagmanager.google.com/) containers, the recommended way to add and manage 3rd party JavaScript on your site.

Google Tag Manager provides comprehensive integration with [Google Analytics](google-tag-manager/google-analytics.md), [Google Optimize](google-tag-manager/optimize.md) and other tools in the 360 suite. Additionally, there is built-in support for services including [ChartBeat](https://chartbeat.com/), [comScore](https://www.comscore.com/), [Parse.ly](https://www.parse.ly/), [Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com/) and [many more](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6106924).

[Conversion tracking](google-tag-manager/conversion-tracking.md) can also be handled through GTM and the data collected used to set up [remarketing](google-tag-manager/remarketing.md).
