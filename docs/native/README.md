# Native Analytics

Altis Analytics provides a built in tool for tracking and analyzing user behavior across the site in real time. It is enabled by default but can be switched off via the configuration file:

```json
{
	"extra": {
		"altis": {
			"modules": {
				"analytics": {
					"native": false
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Analytics data is stored in an S3 data lake and delivered to Elasticsearch where it is 1-5 minutes behind real-time.

The data is queried from Elasticsearch in the application providing a powerful query language with filtering and aggregations for collecting statistics and other metrics.

Altis Analytics can power features such as popular posts widgets, personalisation and A/B tests.
